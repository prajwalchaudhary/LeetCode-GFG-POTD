Given a linked list containing n head nodes where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:
(i) next points to the next node in the list.
(ii) bottom points to a sub-linked list where the current node is the head.
Each of the sub-linked lists nodes and the head nodes are sorted in ascending order based on their data. Flatten the linked list such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.

Note:
1. ↓ represents the bottom pointer and → represents the next pointer.
2. The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer.

Examples:

Input:
Output: 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 -> 19 -> 20 -> 22 -> 28 -> 40 -> 45.
Explanation: 
Bottom pointer of 5 is pointing to 7.
Bottom pointer of 7 is pointing to 8.
Bottom pointer of 10 is pointing to 20 and so on.
So, after flattening the linked list the sorted list will be 
5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 -> 19 -> 20 -> 22 -> 28 -> 40 -> 45.

Input:
Output: 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 -> 19 -> 22 -> 28 -> 30 -> 50
Explanation:
Bottom pointer of 5 is pointing to 7.
Bottom pointer of 7 is pointing to 8.
Bottom pointer of 8 is pointing to 30 and so on.
So, after flattening the linked list the sorted list will be 
5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 -> 19 -> 22 -> 28 -> 30 -> 50.

Constraints:
0 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ number of nodes in sub-linked list(mi) ≤ 50
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 104

        }
        
        Node* hook = new Node(-1);
        itr = hook;
        while(!q.empty()){
            Node* node = q.top();
            q.pop();
            
            itr->bottom = node;
            itr = itr->bottom;
