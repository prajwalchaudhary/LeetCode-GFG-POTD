You are given the heads of two non-empty singly linked lists, head1 and head2, that intersect at a certain point. Return that Node where these two linked lists intersect.

Note: It is guaranteed that the intersected node always exists.

In the custom input you have to give input for CommonList which pointed at the end of both head1 and head2 to form a Y-shaped linked list.

Examples:

Input: head1: 10 -> 15 -> 30, head2: 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 15 -> 30
Output: 15
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 15 -> 30, whose starting point is 15.
    
Input: head1: 4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5, head2: 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5
Output: 1
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 1 -> 8 -> 5, whose starting point is 1.
    
Constraints:
2 ≤ total number of nodes ≤ 2*105
-104 ≤ node->data ≤ 104


CODE : 

/*
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
  public:
    Node* intersectPoint(Node* head1, Node* head2) {
        Node *a = head1;
        Node *b = head2;
        while(a!=b){
            if(a==NULL){
                a=head2;
            }
            else{
                a=a->next;
            }
            if(b==NULL){
                b=head1;
            }
            else{
                b=b->next;
            }
        }
        return a;
    }
};
