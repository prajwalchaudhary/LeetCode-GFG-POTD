You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214

Constraints:

n == grid.length
1 <= n <= 5000

code :

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfWays(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        long long x = 6, y = 6;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            long long new_x = (3 * x + 2 * y) % MOD;
            long long new_y = (2 * x + 2 * y) % MOD;
            x = new_x;
            y = new_y;
        }

        return (x + y) % MOD;
    }
};
